# 01 HTML, CSS: Code Refactor

## Description

This poroject intels learning the semantics of HTML elments and also cleaning the code of the ccs. 

The motivation of building this project was to learn the semantics of HTML elemntes and to learn not to be so repetitive on the css code. 

I was provided with an index.html and a style.ccs file. The proble was the html file had all div and had no semantic structure. As for the style.css it was repetitive and repetive itself on the css that it need it to implement in the html elemente, insted of just creating one id or class that would be necessary to implement in various html elements. 

I learn that it's necesarry for your html to follow a logical struture. It's necesarry to have a sequential order, it help modifiing and finding what your looking for. Also having accessible alt attrinutes helps you modifide them in the style.css by giving them a correct name another person will be able to understand where is what. 

I also learn that you need to keep your css as clean as possible and not be repetived. Creating a general id or class of what type of ccs you want to implement it's much easier that trying to grabe each element one by one from the HTML file.
